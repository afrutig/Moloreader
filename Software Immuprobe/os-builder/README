The os-builder scripts build an image for the RaspberryPi 2 from scratch.
Building should be done on a Archlinux system such as Antergor or Manjaro.

Quick Start:
Build a fresh image with:
	make
Copy the image to the microsd card:
sudo dd if=immuprobe.img of=/dev/sd??

Insert the card into the Pi and start it. On the first boot a lot of things will be installed. This takes some minutes. To watch installation progress, log in on the Pi as user 'alarm', password 'alarm'. Then execute this command:
journalctl -f -t firstboot

Makefile:
Build a fresh image with: make

firstboot:
Scripts to be executed on the RaspberryPi after it's first boot.

packages.conf:
Contains additional packages for the RaspberryPi image.

pacman.conf:
Configuration for the packet manager.

config-files:
Files that will be copied onto the image. The directory structure in config-files is the same as it will be on the root filesystem on the image.
